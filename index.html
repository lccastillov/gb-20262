      <h1>Geomática Básica Grupo 3</h1>
      <h2>Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias</h2>
      <p>
  This course is a theoretical–practical undergraduate course that is taught as part of the Agricultural Engineering programme.
  It aims  introducing students to the fundamental concepts, methods, and tools of geomatics and their application to the analysis and management of agricultural production systems.
  Throughout the course, students develop competencies in the spatial representation, analysis, and interpretation of environmental variables, strengthening spatial thinking focused on Agriculutre-related topics. 
  By integrating conceptual foundations, guided practical workshops, and the development of a final project, the course promotes a critical and applied use of Geographic Information Systems and other geomatic tools to address real-world agricultural situations.

      Classroom platform, as well as additional information they independently research.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Peers discussion:</strong>
      Students will engage with their peers through activities focused on discussion,
      analysis, and collaborative knowledge construction.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Expert dialogue:</strong>
      Students will participate in discussion sessions and question-and-answer activities
      with subject-matter experts to deepen their understanding of key concepts.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Observation and experimentation:</strong>
      Students will carry out observation and experimentation activities aimed at
